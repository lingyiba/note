- #### Let $O$ be the coordinate origin of the plane coordinate system, randomly pick a point in the area ${(x,y)|1≤x^{2}+y^{2}≤4}$, and record this point as $A $ , then the probability that the inclination angle of straight line $OA$ is not greater than $\frac{\pi}{4}$ is
    - $\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$ # Distance formula
    - $x^2+y^2=r^2$ # Circle equation
    - $A=\pi r^2$ # Area of a circle formula
